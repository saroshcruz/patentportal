        <p className="text-lg">
          A patentability search is a comprehensive investigation into existing patents, published applications, and
          prior art to determine whether your invention is novel and non-obvious enough to qualify for patent
          protection. This critical first step in the patent process can save you significant time, money, and resources
          by identifying potential obstacles before you invest in a full patent application.
